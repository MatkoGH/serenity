My WWDC23 Swift Student Challenge submission!

Serenity is an app that helps its users cope with the hardships of stress and builds a path toward a future without it.

## Screenshots
Below are some screenshots I took within the application.

### Welcome & onboarding
The great, big welcome for the user. We immediately want to instill a calm vibe upon the user, as it is the whole point of the app.

|1. The big hero screen.|2. Welcome, user!|
|:---------------------|:----------------|
|The big hero screen, screaming the app's name with a satisfying green gradient.|The goal here is to welcome the user into the application and prepare them for a little 'chat' before they begin.|

|3. Defining 'stress'.|4. Finishing touches.|
|:--------------------|:--------------------|
|Next, we want to define the word 'stress' to the user and explain that it is not a bad thing.|Last up is to explain, in very simple terms, what the app will do and how it may benefit them.|

### Home
The home screen is a horizontally-scrolling stack. This is not quite visible upon first glance which is why I implemented a feature discovery feature. *Great choice of words there, eh?*
Each of the preventions below contain a short description and have a list of benefits. The exception is the last slide which contains the prevention tips because each tip has its own benefits.

|1. Breathing exercises|2. The Pomodoro technique|3. Stress prevention tips|
|:---------------------|:------------------------|:------------------------|
|This prevention contains a short list of breathing exercises for the user to try.|This is a Pomodoro timer. This is a very helpful tool when the user needs to get work done.|This last 'prevention' contains tips for stress coping and prevention.|
